Modem uses organizations to manage team access and data. Each organization is a separate workspace with its own integrations, data, and team members.

## Organizations

An organization is your team's workspace in Modem. It contains:

- Connected integrations (Slack, Discord, GitHub, etc.)
- All ingested feedback data
- Team members and their roles
- Settings and configuration

Most teams have one organization, but you can create multiple if you need separate workspaces (e.g., for different products or business units).

### Creating an Organization

When you first sign up for Modem:

1. Sign in at [app.modem.dev](https://app.modem.dev)
2. Click **Create Organization**
3. Enter your organization name (usually your company or product name)
4. Choose a URL slug (e.g., `acme` for `app.modem.dev/acme`)

You become the **owner** of the organization automatically.

### Organization Settings

Access settings via **Settings** → **Organization** in the dashboard.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Your organization's display name |
| **Slug** | URL identifier (must be unique) |
| **Domain** | Company email domain for auto-join |
| **Auto-join** | Allow users with matching email domain to join automatically |

## Team Roles

Modem has three roles with different permission levels:

### Owner

Full control over the organization:
- All admin permissions
- Manage billing and subscription
- Delete the organization
- Change domain and auto-join settings
- Cannot be removed (except by another owner)

<Warning>
  Every organization must have at least one owner. You cannot remove the last owner.
</Warning>

### Admin

Can manage team and settings:
- Invite and remove members
- Update organization name and slug
- Enable/disable GitHub and Slack auto-join
- Cannot change billing or delete the organization

### Member

Standard access:
- View all organization data
- Use all features (search, agent, topics, etc.)
- Cannot invite or manage other members
- Cannot change organization settings

## Inviting Team Members

Admins and owners can invite new members:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Click **Add Members**
3. Enter email addresses (comma-separated for multiple)
4. Select a role (Member, Admin, or Owner)
5. Click **Send Invitations**

Invited users receive an email with a link to join. Invitations expire after a set period.

### Managing Invitations

View pending invitations in **Settings** → **Team**. You can:
- See who was invited and by whom
- Cancel pending invitations
- Resend invitations if needed

## Auto-Join

Auto-join lets users with matching email domains join your organization automatically, without an invitation.

### Email Domain Auto-Join

1. Go to **Settings** → **Organization**
2. Enter your company domain (e.g., `acme.com`)
3. Enable **Auto-join**

Now, anyone who signs up with an `@acme.com` email is automatically added to your organization as a **member**.

<Info>
  Free email domains (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.) cannot be used for auto-join.
</Info>

### Slack Auto-Join

When you connect a Slack workspace, members of that workspace can automatically join your Modem organization:

1. Connect your Slack workspace
2. In organization settings, enable **Slack Auto-Join** (enabled by default)

When a Slack user accesses Modem, they're automatically added as a member.

### GitHub Auto-Join

Similarly, if you have a GitHub organization connected:

1. Connect your GitHub organization
2. Enable **GitHub Auto-Join** in organization settings

Members of your GitHub organization can join automatically.

## Removing Team Members

Admins and owners can remove members:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Find the member to remove
3. Click the menu (⋮) and select **Remove**
4. Confirm the removal

Removed members immediately lose access to the organization. Their historical actions (invitations sent, etc.) are preserved for audit purposes.

<Note>
  You cannot remove yourself if you're the last owner. Transfer ownership first or add another owner.
</Note>

## Switching Organizations

If you belong to multiple organizations:

1. Click the organization switcher in the sidebar
2. Select the organization you want to access

Each organization is completely separate: data, integrations, and settings don't overlap.

## Billing

Billing is managed at the organization level.

### Plans

| Plan | Included |
|------|----------|
| **Free** | 5,000 events/month, 1 user, 30-day history |
| **Pro** | 100,000 events/month, unlimited users, 90-day history |
| **Business** | 1,000,000 events/month, unlimited users, 180-day history |

### Managing Billing

Owners can manage billing:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. View current plan and usage
3. Click **Manage Billing** to access the billing portal

From the billing portal you can:
- Upgrade or downgrade your plan
- Update payment method
- View invoices and billing history

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate roles">
    Not everyone needs to be an admin. Give members the minimum role they need. Reserve owner for people who need billing access or full control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enable auto-join for your team">
    If everyone at your company should have access, enable email domain auto-join. It reduces invitation overhead and ensures no one is blocked from accessing feedback.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review team access periodically">
    Check your team list occasionally. Remove members who have left the company or no longer need access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Have multiple owners">
    Don't rely on a single owner. Add at least one backup owner in case the primary is unavailable.
  </Accordion>
