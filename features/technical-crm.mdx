Modem includes a technical CRM that automatically builds and maintains profiles for the people and companies you interact with across your connected platforms.

## Overview

As messages flow in from Slack, Discord, GitHub, and other sources, Modem automatically creates **Person** and **Company** records. These records are enriched with profile data, linked across platforms, and connected to their conversation history.

<Info>
  Person records are created automatically when messages are ingested. You don't need to manually add contacts.
</Info>

## People

### Automatic Person Creation

When a message arrives from a new author, Modem:

1. Checks if this platform identity (Slack user ID, GitHub username, etc.) already exists
2. Attempts to match by email address to avoid duplicates
3. Creates or links the identity to a Person record
4. Stores any email addresses provided by the platform

This happens automatically: every author who sends a message gets a Person record.

### Person Profiles

Each person has a rich profile:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Display Name** | Name shown across the platform |
| **Avatar** | Profile picture |
| **Emails** | One or more email addresses (one marked primary) |
| **Description** | Bio or notes about the person |
| **Job Title** | Current role |
| **Company** | Associated company (with employment history) |
| **VIP Status** | Flag for high-priority contacts |

### Social Connections

Track professional links for each person:

- LinkedIn profile
- GitHub username
- Twitter/X handle
- Personal website
- Phone number

### Platform Identities

A single Person can have identities across multiple platforms:

```
Jane Smith (Person)
├── jane@acme.com (Slack)
├── janesmith (GitHub)
└── jane#1234 (Discord)
```

When Jane sends a message on any platform, it's attributed to the same Person record. This gives you a complete view of their interactions across all channels.

### Expertise Tags

After enrichment, persons can have:

- **Ecosystem Tags.** Technologies they work with (React, Kubernetes, Python).
- **Expertise Tags.** Skills and specializations (Frontend Development, DevOps, API Design).

These help you find the right people to talk to about specific topics.

## Companies

### Company Records

Companies represent organizations your users belong to:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Company name |
| **Logo** | Company logo |
| **Domains** | Email domains (acme.com, acme.io) |
| **Industry** | Industry classification |
| **Size** | Employee count range |
| **Website** | Company URL |
| **VIP Status** | Flag for key accounts |

### Social Connections

Track company presence:

- LinkedIn company page
- GitHub organization
- Twitter/X account
- Contact email and phone

### Company Domains

Companies can have multiple email domains:

```
Acme Corporation
├── acme.com (primary)
├── acme.io
└── acme-corp.com
```

When a person's email matches a company domain, they can be linked to that company.

## Person-Company Relationships

People and companies have a many-to-many relationship:

- A person can work at multiple companies (current and past)
- A company has multiple employees
- Each relationship includes role, start date, and end date

### Employment History

Track career progression:

```
Jane Smith
├── Acme Corp (2022-present) - Senior Engineer
└── StartupXYZ (2019-2022) - Engineer
```

This history is preserved when someone changes jobs, so you don't lose the context of past relationships.

## Enrichment

Enrichment uses AI-powered web search to automatically discover information about people and companies.

### How It Works

1. Click **Enrich** on a person or company profile
2. Modem searches the web using available context (name, email, company)
3. AI extracts structured data from search results
4. Profile fields are updated non-destructively

<Tip>
  Enrichment never overwrites existing data. If you've manually entered information, it's preserved.
</Tip>

### What Enrichment Discovers

**For People:**
- Full name and bio
- LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter profiles
- Personal website
- Job title
- Ecosystem and expertise tags

**For Companies:**
- Description
- Website and social profiles
- Industry classification
- Company size
- Headquarters location

### Confidence Scores

Each enrichment includes a confidence score (0-1):

- **High confidence (≥0.7).** Data is reliable.
- **Lower confidence.** May benefit from manual review.

## Merging Duplicates

When duplicate Person or Company records exist, they can be merged:

1. Select the source record (will be merged away)
2. Select the target record (will receive the data)
3. All identities, emails, and relationships transfer to the target
4. The source record is marked as merged

### What Transfers

- All platform identities
- All email addresses
- Company associations
- GitHub connections

### Audit Trail

Merges are logged and can be reverted if needed. The merge history shows:
- Who performed the merge
- When it happened
- What records were combined

## Change History

All changes to Person and Company records are automatically tracked:

- **What changed.** Before and after values.
- **Who changed it.** User, system, or AI agent.
- **When.** Timestamp of the change.

This audit trail helps you understand how records evolved over time.

## Working with the CRM

### Browsing People

Navigate to **People** to see all contacts:

- **Search** by name, email, or company
- **Filter** by VIP status, company, or activity
- **Sort** by recent activity, name, or creation date

Click on a person to see their full profile, message history, and topics they've participated in.

### Browsing Companies

Navigate to **Companies** to see all organizations:

- **Search** by name or domain
- **Filter** by VIP status or size
- **View** associated people and their activity

### VIP Flagging

Mark important contacts and accounts as VIP:

- VIP people appear highlighted in lists
- VIP companies help prioritize their employees' feedback
- Use VIP status to focus on key relationships

## Use Cases

### Understanding Your Users

See the complete picture for any user:

### Account-Level Insights

Aggregate feedback by company:
- What are Acme's engineers complaining about?
- Which companies are most engaged?
- What topics does this account care about?

### Finding Experts

Use expertise tags to find the right people:
- Who in our community knows about Kubernetes?
- Which users work with React?

### Relationship Continuity

When someone changes companies:
- Their Person record persists
