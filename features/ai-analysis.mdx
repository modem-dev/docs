---

Modem uses AI throughout the platform to transform raw messages into structured, actionable insights. Here's how it works.

## Core AI Capabilities

### Topic Discovery

Modem automatically discovers conversation themes across your data sources:

- **Semantic clustering.** Messages with similar meaning are grouped together, even if they use different words.
- **Cross-source correlation.** A Slack discussion and a GitHub issue about the same problem are connected.
- **Temporal awareness.** Conversations about the same topic at different times are recognized.

<Info>
  Topic discovery happens continuously as new messages arrive. You don't need to configure or train anything.
</Info>

### Conversation Segmentation

Within channels, Modem identifies where one conversation ends and another begins:

- **Context switching.** When the discussion shifts to a new subject.
- **Time gaps.** Extended pauses between messages suggest new conversations.
- **Participant changes.** Different people joining often signals topic shifts.

This segmentation creates meaningful conversation groups within topics.

### Feedback Classification

Every message is analyzed and categorized:

| Category | What It Detects |
|----------|-----------------|
| Bug Report | Error descriptions, broken functionality, unexpected behavior |
| Feature Request | Suggestions, wishlist items, enhancement ideas |
| Question | Help requests, clarification needs, how-to queries |
| Complaint | Frustration, dissatisfaction, negative experiences |
| Praise | Positive feedback, compliments, appreciation |

Classification considers both content and context for accuracy.

### Summarization

Modem generates summaries at multiple levels:

- **Topic summaries.** What a topic is about, key themes, main concerns.
- **Group summaries.** What each conversation segment covers.
- **Trend summaries.** Patterns across time periods.

These summaries save you from reading every message to understand what's happening.

## How It Works

### Vector Embeddings

When a message arrives, it's converted into a **vector embedding**, a numerical representation that captures its meaning:

```
"The export button doesn't work on Safari"
        ↓
[0.023, -0.156, 0.089, ..., 0.234]  (1536 dimensions)
```

This embedding allows Modem to:
- Find semantically similar messages (even with different wording)
- Match new messages to existing topics
- Power natural language search

### AI Models

Modem uses multiple AI models for different tasks:

| Task | Model Type |
|------|------------|
| Embeddings | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small |
| Classification | Claude (Anthropic) |
| Summarization | Claude (Anthropic) |
| Agent conversations | Claude (Anthropic) |

### Processing Pipeline

This happens in near real-time. Messages typically appear in your dashboard within seconds.

## Accuracy and Confidence

### Confidence Scores

Modem provides confidence indicators for AI-generated insights:

- **Topic confidence.** How well the grouped messages fit together.
- **Classification confidence.** How certain the feedback categorization is.
- **Match confidence.** How strongly a message relates to a topic.

Higher confidence = more reliable analysis.

### Limitations

AI analysis isn't perfect. Be aware of:

- **Ambiguous messages.** Short or unclear messages may be miscategorized.
- **Context-dependent meaning.** Sarcasm, inside jokes, or domain jargon can confuse analysis.
- **Edge cases.** Messages that don't fit typical patterns.

<Tip>
  Use confidence scores as guides. For important decisions, review the source messages directly.
</Tip>

## Customization

### What You Can Adjust

Currently, Modem's AI analysis runs with default settings optimized for general use cases. The system is designed to work well out of the box without configuration.

### What's Coming

Future releases may include:
- Custom classification categories
- Topic grouping preferences
- Domain-specific vocabulary training

## Privacy and Data Handling

### How Your Data is Processed

- Messages are processed through AI services to generate embeddings and classifications
- Embeddings are stored for search and matching
- Original messages are retained for display and reference

### Data Retention

- Your data remains in your Modem organization
- Data is not shared with other organizations
- AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) process data according to their enterprise data policies

<Info>
  Modem uses enterprise AI service tiers with appropriate data handling agreements.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trust but verify">
    AI analysis is highly accurate for most cases, but review important topics and classifications directly. Use AI as a time-saver, not a replacement for judgment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Look at confidence scores">
    Low-confidence topics or classifications may need human review. High-confidence results are typically reliable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use summaries as starting points">
    Topic summaries give you the gist quickly. For full context, dive into the source messages.
