Scheduled tasks let you automate recurring operations in Modem, from weekly digests to automated issue triage.

## What Are Scheduled Tasks?

Scheduled tasks are automated workflows that run on a schedule you define. They can:

- Generate and deliver feedback summaries
- Monitor for specific patterns or thresholds
- Sync data with external systems
- Trigger alerts based on conditions

## Common Use Cases

### Weekly Feedback Digest

Get a summary of the week's feedback delivered to Slack every Monday:

- Top bug reports
- Trending feature requests
- Notable praise and complaints
- Key metrics changes

### Daily Bug Monitoring

Check for new critical issues every morning:

- New bug reports in the last 24 hours
- High-volume topics gaining traction
- Unresolved issues from priority customers

### Monthly Reports

Generate comprehensive monthly summaries:

- Feedback volume trends
- Category breakdowns
- Top participants and companies
- Topic evolution over time

### Threshold Alerts

Get notified when patterns emerge:

- Spike in complaints (e.g., 5x normal volume)
- Multiple reports of the same issue
- Negative sentiment from key accounts

  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the action">
    Specify what the task should do:
    - Query type (digest, alert, sync)

## Managing Tasks

### Viewing Task History

See when tasks ran and what they produced:

1. Go to **Scheduled Tasks**
2. Click on a task
3. View **Run History**

Each run shows:
- When it executed
- What was produced
- Delivery status
- Any errors

### Editing Tasks

Modify a task's schedule or configuration:

1. Go to **Scheduled Tasks**
2. Click **Edit** on the task
3. Make changes
4. Save

Changes take effect for the next scheduled run.

### Pausing Tasks

Temporarily disable a task:

1. Toggle the task to **Disabled**
2. The task won't run until re-enabled
3. Re-enable anytime

### Deleting Tasks

Remove a task permanently:

1. Click **Delete** on the task
2. Confirm deletion
3. Historical runs are preserved for audit

## Advanced: Custom Queries

For power users, define custom queries using the Agent's capabilities:

```
Summarize all bug reports from enterprise customers
in the last week, grouped by severity, and highlight
any that mention "data loss" or "security"
```

The scheduled task will run this query and deliver results on schedule.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task didn't run">
    - Check if the task is enabled
    - Verify the schedule configuration
    - Look at run history for errors
    - Ensure delivery destination is configured
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Results are empty">
    - Check filters, as they may be too restrictive
    - Verify data exists for the time range
    - Ensure integrations are connected and syncing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delivery failed">
    - For Slack: Verify bot is in the channel
    - For email: Check addresses are valid
    - For webhooks: Verify endpoint is accessible
    - Check delivery logs for specific errors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with templates">
    Templates are optimized for common use cases. Customize from there rather than building from scratch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match schedule to value">
    Daily digests work for active channels. Weekly is enough for lower-volume sources. Don't create noise with too-frequent reports.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Route to the right audience">
    Send bug summaries to engineering, feature requests to product, customer sentiment to success teams.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and iterate">
    Check that scheduled reports are being used. Adjust content and frequency based on feedback from your team.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
