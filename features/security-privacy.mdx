## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is my data protected?

**Encryption at rest and in transit.** All customer data is encrypted when stored and when transmitted over the internet using industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2+). This includes messages, user profiles, and any files processed by Modem.

**Access controls.** We enforce the principle of least privilege—employees only access data required for their specific job function. All access to production systems requires multi-factor authentication.

**Regular security assessments.** We conduct quarterly vulnerability scans on public-facing systems and annual penetration testing by independent security firms.

### Who has access to my data?

**Limited employee access.** Only authorized Modem employees with a documented business need can access customer data. Access is logged and audited.

**No third-party data sharing.** We do not sell or share your data with third parties for their own purposes. Data is only shared with service providers necessary to operate Modem (see subprocessors below).

**Quarterly access reviews.** We review all employee access permissions quarterly to ensure they remain appropriate. When employees leave, access is revoked within 2 business days.

### Where is my data stored?

**Cloud infrastructure.** Modem runs on Cloudflare's global network with data stored in secure, SOC 2 compliant data centers.

**Geographic considerations.** For customers with specific data residency requirements, contact us to discuss available options.

**Physical security.** Our data center providers maintain strict physical security controls including restricted access, surveillance systems, and environmental protections.

### How long do you keep my data?

**Retention policy.** We retain customer data for the duration of your subscription plus a reasonable period for account recovery. Upon contract termination or at your request, data is securely deleted.

**Secure deletion.** When data is deleted, we use cryptographic destruction methods—not just soft deletion. This ensures data cannot be recovered.

**Backups.** Backups are maintained for disaster recovery purposes and follow the same retention and deletion policies as primary data.

### What happens if there's a security incident?

**Incident response plan.** We maintain a documented incident response process that includes immediate containment, investigation, notification, and remediation steps.

**Customer notification.** If we discover a security incident affecting your data, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible with details about what happened and what we're doing about it.

**Regulatory notification.** We comply with all applicable breach notification laws and will notify relevant authorities within required timeframes.

**Post-incident review.** After any incident, we conduct a thorough review to understand root causes and implement measures to prevent recurrence.

### What are my privacy rights?

**GDPR rights.** If you're in the EU/EEA, you have the right to:
- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Request deletion of your data
- Restrict processing
- Data portability
- Object to processing

**Exercising rights.** To exercise any privacy rights, email [support@modem.dev](mailto:support@modem.dev). We respond to requests within 30 days.

**Data Processing Agreement.** Enterprise customers can request a DPA that documents our data processing commitments.

### How do you manage third-party services?

**Vendor assessment.** All service providers that access customer data must pass our security assessment before engagement. We evaluate their security practices, compliance certifications, and data handling procedures.

**Contractual protections.** We maintain Data Processing Agreements with all subprocessors that handle customer data, ensuring they meet our security and privacy standards.

**Ongoing monitoring.** Critical vendors are reviewed annually to ensure continued compliance with our security requirements.

**Key subprocessors:**
- Cloudflare (infrastructure, compute, storage)
- OpenAI (AI processing for embeddings)
- Anthropic (AI processing for analysis)
- Resend (transactional email)
- Stripe (payment processing)

### What security certifications does Modem have?

**SOC 2 Type II.** We have completed a SOC 2 Type II audit, which evaluates our security controls over an extended period. This report is available to customers under NDA.

**Ongoing compliance.** We maintain continuous compliance through regular internal audits, automated security monitoring, and annual third-party assessments.

### How can I report a security issue?

**Security contact.** If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please report it to [security@modem.dev](mailto:security@modem.dev).

**Responsible disclosure.** We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to understand and address any issues. We do not take legal action against security researchers who act in good faith.

## Security Best Practices for Your Team

While Modem protects your data on our end, here are recommendations for your team:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use strong authentication">
    Enable two-factor authentication for all team members. Use unique, strong passwords or a password manager.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review team access regularly">
    Periodically review who has access to your Modem organization. Remove access for team members who no longer need it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be mindful of connected data">
    Consider what channels you connect to Modem. Avoid connecting channels with highly sensitive information (credentials, PII, financial data).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protect API tokens">
    If you use MCP or API access, treat tokens like passwords. Don't commit them to code repositories or share them insecurely.
