---

The Slack integration captures messages from your Slack workspaces, including support channels, community discussions, and customer communications.

## What Gets Captured

- **Messages** — All messages in selected channels
- **Threads** — Full thread conversations with replies
- **Reactions** — Emoji reactions on messages
- **User Profiles** — Names, avatars, and email addresses (when available)
- **Channel Metadata** — Channel names, descriptions, and types

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the Slack workspace you want to connect (or permission to install apps)
- A Modem organization

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Slack** in your Modem dashboard and click **Connect Slack**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Modem">
    You'll be redirected to Slack to authorize the Modem app. Review the permissions and click **Allow**.

    <Info>
      Modem requests read access to messages in channels you specify. It does not post messages or modify your workspace.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select channels">
    After authorization, select which channels Modem should monitor. You can choose:
    - Public channels
    - Private channels (if you have access)
    - Shared channels (if applicable)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start sync">
    Click **Complete Setup**. Modem will begin syncing historical messages and listening for new ones.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing Channels

### Recommended Channels

- `#support` or `#help` — Customer support requests
- `#feedback` or `#suggestions` — Feature requests and ideas
- `#bugs` or `#issues` — Bug reports
- Community channels where users discuss your product

### Channels to Avoid

- Internal team channels (unless you want internal feedback analyzed)
- Bot notification channels (high noise, low signal)
- Channels with sensitive information

<Tip>
  You can always add or remove channels later from the integration settings.
</Tip>

## Historical Data

When you first connect Slack, Modem syncs historical messages:

- **Public channels** — Up to 90 days of history (Slack API limits)
- **Private channels** — Up to 90 days (requires appropriate access)

After initial sync, new messages are captured in real-time.

## Slack Connect Channels

If you use Slack Connect to communicate with customers or partners, Modem can capture those conversations too:

1. Ensure the Modem app is installed in your workspace
2. Select the Slack Connect channel during channel selection
3. Modem will capture messages from all participants

<Note>
  Modem only captures messages in Slack Connect channels from your workspace's perspective. You cannot access messages in channels you're not part of.
</Note>

## Using Modem in Slack

Beyond capturing messages, Modem provides interactive features in Slack:

### Link Unfurling

When you paste a Modem URL (topic, participant, etc.) in Slack, Modem automatically unfurls it with a preview.

### @mention the Modem Bot

You can @mention the Modem bot in channels to:
- Ask questions about your feedback data
- Get summaries of recent activity
- Search for related topics

<Info>
  The Modem bot must be added to channels where you want to use @mentions.
</Info>

## Permissions Explained

The Modem Slack app requests these permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels |
| `channels:read` | See channel list and metadata |
| `groups:history` | Read messages in private channels |
| `groups:read` | See private channel list |
| `users:read` | Get user profile information |
| `users:read.email` | Get user email addresses |
| `reactions:read` | See emoji reactions |
| `links:read` | Enable link unfurling |

Modem does **not** request permissions to:
- Post messages on your behalf
- Modify channels or users
- Access direct messages

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Messages aren't appearing">
    - Verify the channel is selected in integration settings
    - Check that the Modem app is installed in the workspace
    - For private channels, ensure Modem has been added to the channel
    - Allow a few minutes for initial sync to complete
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Historical messages are missing">
    Slack API limits historical access to approximately 90 days for free workspaces and 10,000 messages for paid workspaces. Modem can only access what Slack makes available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User emails aren't showing">
    User email visibility depends on workspace settings. If your workspace restricts email visibility, Modem won't be able to access them.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disconnecting

To disconnect Slack:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Slack**
2. Click **Disconnect**

This stops new data from being captured. Historical data remains in Modem.

To fully remove Modem from your Slack workspace:
1. Go to your Slack workspace settings
2. Navigate to **Apps**
3. Find Modem and click **Remove**
