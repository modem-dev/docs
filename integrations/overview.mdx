## How Integrations Work

### Data Flow

```
Your Tools (Slack, Discord, GitHub, etc.)
            ↓
    Modem Ingestion Layer
            ↓
    Processing & Analysis
            ↓
    Your Modem Dashboard
```

1. **Connection.** You authorize Modem to access your data source via OAuth or API keys.
2. **Historical Sync.** Modem fetches historical messages and events (varies by integration).
3. **Real-time Updates.** New messages and events are captured as they happen.
4. **Processing.** Messages are analyzed, categorized, and organized into topics.

### What Gets Captured

Each integration captures different types of data:

| Integration | Messages | Reactions | Threads | Events |
|-------------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Slack | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Discord | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| GitHub | Yes (comments) | Yes | Yes | Yes (issues, PRs) |
| Linear | Yes (comments) | No | No | Yes (issues) |
| Email | Yes | No | Yes (replies) | No |

## Choosing What to Connect

### Start with High-Value Sources

Not all channels contain useful feedback. Prioritize:

- **Support channels.** Where users ask questions and report issues.
- **Community channels.** Where users discuss your product.
- **Feedback channels.** Dedicated spaces for suggestions and requests.

Avoid:
- Internal team channels (unless you want to analyze internal feedback)
- Bot-heavy channels with little human discussion
- Channels with sensitive information you don't want in Modem

### Channel Selection

Most integrations let you select specific channels to monitor rather than capturing everything:

- **Slack.** Choose specific channels during setup.
- **Discord.** Select channels to monitor.
- **GitHub.** Choose repositories to sync.

<Tip>
  Start with a few high-value channels and expand later. It's easier to add channels than to clean up data from noisy sources.
</Tip>

## Managing Integrations

### Adding Integrations

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** in your Modem dashboard
2. Click on the integration you want to add
3. Follow the authorization flow (usually OAuth)
4. Select channels/repositories to sync

### Removing Integrations

To disconnect an integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Find the integration you want to remove
3. Click **Disconnect**

<Warning>
  Disconnecting an integration stops new data from flowing in. Historical data that was already ingested remains in Modem.
</Warning>

### Updating Permissions

If you need to change which channels or repositories are synced:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click on the integration to configure
3. Update channel/repository selection

## Cross-Platform Correlation

When you connect multiple integrations, Modem attempts to correlate participants across platforms:

- Users with the same email across platforms are linked
- Topics can span multiple sources (e.g., a Slack discussion and a GitHub issue about the same problem)
- Search works across all connected sources simultaneously

This gives you a unified view even when conversations happen across different tools.
