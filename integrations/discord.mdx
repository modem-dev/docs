The Discord integration captures messages from your Discord servers, ideal for developer communities, open-source projects, and gaming communities.

## What Gets Captured

- **Messages.** All messages in selected channels.
- **Threads.** Forum posts and thread replies.
- **Reactions.** Emoji reactions on messages.
- **User Profiles.** Usernames, display names, and avatars.
- **Server Metadata.** Channel names and categories.

## Prerequisites

- Admin or moderator access to the Discord server
- Permission to add bots to the server
- A Modem organization

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Discord** in your Modem dashboard and click **Connect Discord**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize the bot">
    You'll be redirected to Discord to add the Modem bot to your server. Select the server you want to connect and click **Authorize**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select channels">
    Return to Modem and select which channels the bot should monitor. You can select:
    - Text channels
    - Forum channels
    - Voice channel text chat
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start sync">
    Click **Complete Setup**. Modem will begin syncing messages and listening for new ones.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing Channels

### Recommended Channels

- `#support` or `#help`: Community support channels
- `#feedback` or `#suggestions`: Feature requests and ideas
- `#bugs` or `#bug-reports`: User-reported issues
- Forum channels for discussions and Q&A

### Channels to Avoid

- Team-only or moderator channels (unless relevant)
- Bot command channels
- Off-topic or meme channels (high noise)

<Tip>
  Start with a few key channels and expand based on what's useful. You can adjust channel selection anytime.
</Tip>

## Historical Data

When you connect Discord, Modem syncs recent message history:

- Initial sync captures recent messages (typically the last few days to weeks)
- After initial sync, all new messages are captured in real-time
- Historical depth depends on message volume and channel activity

## Forum Channels

Discord forum channels work well with Modem:

- Each forum post becomes a trackable conversation
- Replies are captured as part of the thread
- Tags and post metadata are preserved

Forum channels are excellent for structured feedback collection.

## Bot Permissions

The Modem Discord bot requests these permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| Read Messages | View messages in selected channels |
| Read Message History | Access historical messages |
| View Channels | See available channels |

The bot does **not** request permissions to:
- Send messages
- Manage channels or roles
- Kick or ban users
- Access voice channels

<Info>
  The Modem bot operates in read-only mode. It cannot respond to messages or modify your server.
</Info>

## Multiple Servers

You can connect multiple Discord servers to the same Modem organization:

1. Complete setup for the first server
2. Go back to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Discord**
3. Click **Add Another Server**
4. Repeat the authorization process

Each server's data is tracked separately but can be searched together.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot isn't capturing messages">
    - Verify the bot has been added to your server
    - Check that the channel is selected in Modem settings
    - Ensure the bot has permission to view the channel (check channel permissions)
    - Private channels need explicit bot access
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't see some channels">
    The bot can only see channels it has permission to access. Check:
    - Channel-specific permission overrides
    - Category permissions
    - Role permissions for the Modem bot
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing user information">
    Discord doesn't expose user email addresses through the API. Participant profiles for Discord users will include username and display name, but not email.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disconnecting

To disconnect Discord:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Discord**
2. Click **Disconnect** next to the server

To fully remove the bot:
1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Bots**
3. Find Modem and click **Remove**

Historical data remains in Modem after disconnection.
