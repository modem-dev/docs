---

The GitHub integration captures feedback from your repositories, including issues, discussions, and pull request comments.

## What Gets Captured

- **Issues.** Issue titles, descriptions, and comments.
- **Pull Requests.** PR descriptions, review comments, and discussion.
- **Discussions.** GitHub Discussions posts and replies.
- **Reactions.** Emoji reactions on issues and comments.
- **User Profiles.** GitHub usernames and avatars.
- **Labels and Metadata.** Issue labels, states, and assignees.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the GitHub repositories you want to connect (or organization owner permissions)
- A Modem organization

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **GitHub** in your Modem dashboard and click **Connect GitHub**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    You'll be redirected to GitHub to install the Modem GitHub App. Choose:
    - **All repositories.** Modem can access all current and future repositories.
    - **Selected repositories.** Choose specific repositories to connect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize access">
    Review the permissions and click **Install & Authorize**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm repositories">
    Return to Modem and confirm which repositories to sync.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing Repositories

### Recommended

- Your main product repositories with active issue tracking
- Repositories where users submit bug reports or feature requests
- Open-source projects with community contributions

### Consider Carefully

- Private repositories with sensitive information
- Archived or inactive repositories
- Internal tooling repositories (unless tracking internal feedback)

<Tip>
  You can always modify repository selection later through GitHub App settings or Modem integration settings.
</Tip>

## What Modem Tracks

### Issues

- New issues are captured as they're created
- Issue comments are tracked as part of the conversation
- Status changes (open, closed) are recorded
- Labels help categorize feedback

### Pull Requests

- PR descriptions and context
- Review comments and feedback
- Discussion threads
- Related issues (when linked)

### Discussions

If your repository uses GitHub Discussions:
- Discussion posts become trackable topics
- Replies are captured as conversation threads
- Categories and labels are preserved

## Historical Data

When you first connect a repository, Modem syncs:

- Recent issues (open and recently closed)
- Recent pull requests with comments
- Recent discussions (if enabled)

The sync depth depends on repository activity. Very active repositories may have limited historical coverage.

## Permissions

The Modem GitHub App requests:

| Permission | Access | Why It's Needed |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Issues | Read | View issues and comments |
| Pull Requests | Read | View PRs and review comments |
| Discussions | Read | View discussion posts |
| Metadata | Read | Access repository information |

The app does **not** request permissions to:
- Create or modify issues
- Push code or modify files
- Access private repository contents
- Manage repository settings

<Info>
  Modem operates in read-only mode. It cannot create issues, comment on PRs, or modify your repositories.
</Info>

## Real-time Updates

After initial sync, Modem receives real-time updates via webhooks:

- New issues and comments appear within seconds
- PR activity is tracked as it happens
- Discussion updates are captured immediately

## Cross-Linking

GitHub feedback often relates to conversations in other channels:

- A Slack discussion about a bug might reference a GitHub issue
- A Discord feature request might eventually become a GitHub issue

Modem can correlate these across sources when:
- The same user participates (via linked GitHub account)
- Topics share semantic similarity
- Explicit links are present

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository not appearing">
    - Verify the Modem GitHub App is installed for that repository
    - Check your GitHub App installation settings
    - Ensure you have admin access to the repository
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing issues or PRs">
    - Recent activity syncs first; older items may take longer
    - Very old issues may not be synced during initial import
    - Check that the repository is selected in Modem settings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook events not arriving">
    - Verify the GitHub App is properly installed
    - Check GitHub's webhook delivery status in repository settings
    - Modem support can help diagnose webhook issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
