The email integration lets you capture feedback sent via email, routing it into Modem alongside your other data sources.

## How It Works

Modem provides a dedicated inbound email address for your organization. Emails sent to this address are ingested and analyzed like messages from other sources.

**Common use cases:**
- Forward support emails to Modem
- Set up a public feedback email address
- Capture email threads related to customer issues

## What Gets Captured

- **Email content.** Subject line and body text.
- **Sender information.** Name and email address.
- **Thread context.** Reply chains are tracked as conversations.
- **Timestamps.** When emails were sent.
- **Attachments.** Referenced but not stored (links preserved if accessible).

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable email integration">
    Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Email** and click **Enable**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your inbound address">
    Modem generates a unique inbound email address for your organization:
    ```
    feedback-{your-org-id}@inbound.modem.dev
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure forwarding">
    Set up email forwarding from your existing address to the Modem inbound address. See forwarding options below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Forwarding Options

### Option 1: Auto-Forward from Support Address

Configure your email provider to auto-forward copies of emails to Modem:

**Gmail/Google Workspace:**
1. Go to Settings → Forwarding
2. Add the Modem inbound address
3. Choose to forward a copy of incoming mail

**Outlook/Microsoft 365:**
1. Go to Settings → Mail → Forwarding
2. Enable forwarding to the Modem address
3. Keep a copy in your mailbox

### Option 2: Dedicated Feedback Address

Create a public feedback address that forwards to Modem:

1. Create `feedback@yourcompany.com`
2. Set it to forward all mail to your Modem inbound address
3. Share this address with users for feedback

### Option 3: Manual Forwarding

Forward individual emails to Modem when relevant:

1. When you receive feedback worth tracking, forward it to your Modem inbound address
2. The email (including original sender info) will be captured

<Tip>
  Auto-forwarding captures everything automatically. Manual forwarding gives you control over what enters Modem.
</Tip>

## Email Threading

Modem tracks email threads as conversations:

- Initial email creates a new conversation
- Replies are linked to the original thread
- Thread context helps with topic matching

For best thread tracking:
- Preserve email subject lines (don't modify them)
- Keep reply chains intact when forwarding

## Participant Matching

Email addresses are key identifiers for participants:

- If a user emails from `jane@acme.com` and is also `jane@acme.com` in Slack, they're linked
- Email domains help with company association
- New email senders create new participant profiles

## Privacy Considerations

<Warning>
  Be thoughtful about what emails you forward to Modem:
  - Don't forward emails containing sensitive personal information
  - Ensure you have appropriate consent for processing feedback
</Warning>

**Best practices:**
- Use dedicated feedback addresses rather than forwarding all support mail
- Review forwarding rules to exclude sensitive categories
- Inform users if their feedback may be analyzed

## Filtering

Not all emails should be captured. Consider:

**Exclude:**
- Internal team communications
- Automated notifications and receipts
- Emails with sensitive data (billing, legal)

**Include:**
- Feature requests and suggestions
- Bug reports and issue descriptions
- General product feedback
- Support conversations (with appropriate consent)

Set up email rules at your provider to filter before forwarding, or use manual forwarding for control.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Emails not appearing">
    - Verify the forwarding is configured correctly
    - Check that you're forwarding to the correct Modem inbound address
    - Test by sending a test email directly to the inbound address
    - Check your email provider's forwarding logs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Thread context missing">
    - Email threading relies on subject lines and references
    - Heavily modified forwards may lose thread context
    - Try forwarding as an attachment to preserve headers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sender information incorrect">
    - When auto-forwarding, ensure your provider preserves original sender info
    - Some forwarding configurations show your address as the sender
    - Check forwarding settings for "preserve original sender" options
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disconnecting

To stop capturing emails:

1. Remove or disable forwarding rules at your email provider
2. In Modem: **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Email** → **Disable**

Historical email data remains in Modem after disconnection.
