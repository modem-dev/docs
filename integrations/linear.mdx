The Linear integration syncs issues and comments from your Linear workspace, helping you track feedback that flows through your issue tracker.

## What Gets Captured

- **Issues.** Issue titles, descriptions, and status.
- **Comments.** Discussion on issues.
- **Project Context.** Project and team associations.
- **User Profiles.** Linear user information.
- **Metadata.** Labels, priorities, and state changes.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Linear workspace
- A Modem organization

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Linear** in your Modem dashboard and click **Connect Linear**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Modem">
    You'll be redirected to Linear to authorize the connection. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select teams">
    Choose which Linear teams to sync. You can select:
    - All teams in your workspace
    - Specific teams
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start sync">
    Click **Complete Setup**. Modem will begin syncing issues and listening for updates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing Teams

### Recommended

- Teams that handle customer-reported issues
- Product teams that track feature requests
- Teams with external-facing work

### Consider Carefully

- Internal-only teams (HR, ops) unless you want that feedback
- Archived or inactive teams

<Tip>
  Start with your main product team and expand based on what's valuable.
</Tip>

## What Modem Tracks

### Issues

Each Linear issue is tracked with:
- Title and description
- Current state (backlog, in progress, done, etc.)
- Priority and labels
- Team and project assignment
- Assignee information

### Comments

Issue comments are captured as part of the conversation:
- User who commented
- Comment content
- Timestamp
- Any mentions or references

### State Changes

When issues move through your workflow:
- State transitions are recorded
- Completion status is tracked
- Timeline of changes is preserved

## Historical Data

On initial connection, Modem syncs:
- Active issues (not archived)
- Recent completed issues
- Comments on synced issues

The depth of historical sync depends on workspace size and activity.

## Permissions

The Modem Linear integration requests:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| Read issues | View issue content and metadata |
| Read comments | Access discussion on issues |
| Read users | Get user profile information |
| Read teams | See team structure |

Modem does **not** request permissions to:
- Create or modify issues
- Change issue state or assignments
- Modify workspace settings

<Info>
  Modem operates in read-only mode. It cannot create or modify issues in Linear.
</Info>

## Connecting Feedback to Issues

Linear issues often originate from feedback in other channels:

**Common flow:**
1. User reports bug in Slack or Discord
2. Team creates Linear issue to track the fix
3. Issue discussion happens in Linear
4. Fix is deployed, issue is closed

Modem can connect these by:
- Linking participants across platforms (when identifiable)
- Semantic matching between channel discussions and issue content
- Tracking explicit references and links

## Use Cases

### Tracking Issue Resolution

See which user-reported problems have been addressed:
- Original feedback in Slack/Discord
- Corresponding Linear issue
- Resolution status

### Understanding Issue Volume

Analyze patterns in your issue tracker:
- Types of issues being created
- Teams with most activity
- Time to resolution trends

### Connecting Feedback to Roadmap

Link feature requests from community channels to Linear issues:
- See which requests became planned work
- Track progress on user-requested features

## Troubleshooting
