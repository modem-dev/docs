Get started with Modem by connecting a data source and exploring your user feedback.

## Prerequisites

- A Modem account ([sign up here](https://app.modem.dev) if you haven't already)
- Access to at least one communication channel (Slack, Discord, or GitHub)

## Step 1: Create Your Organization

After signing up, you'll create an organization. This is your workspace where all your data sources and team members are managed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Modem">
    Go to [app.modem.dev](https://app.modem.dev) and sign in with your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an organization">
    Click **Create Organization** and give it a name (usually your company or product name).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite your team (optional)">
    Add team members who should have access to your feedback data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect a Data Source

Choose the integration that makes sense for your team. We recommend starting with wherever your users communicate most.

<Tip>
  You can connect multiple data sources. Modem will correlate participants across platforms when possible.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Wait for Initial Sync

After connecting an integration, Modem begins ingesting historical data. Depending on the volume:

- **Small channels** (< 1,000 messages): A few minutes
- **Medium channels** (1,000-10,000 messages): 10-30 minutes
- **Large channels** (10,000+ messages): Up to a few hours

You'll see data appear in your dashboard as it's processed.

## Step 4: Explore Your Data

Once data starts flowing, explore the key sections of your dashboard:

  <Accordion title="Topics" icon="layer-group">
    AI-discovered conversation themes. Modem automatically groups related messages into topics, even across different channels and platforms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Participants" icon="users">
    Users who have interacted across your connected sources. See their feedback history, engagement patterns, and associated companies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Feedback" icon="comment">
    Browse user feedback categorized by type: bug reports, feature requests, complaints, praise, and questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent" icon="robot">
    Ask the Modem agent questions about your data in natural language. "What are users complaining about this week?" or "Show me feature requests related to authentication."
