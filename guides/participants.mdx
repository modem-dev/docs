description: "Understanding unified user profiles across your data sources"
---

Participants are the users who interact across your connected data sources. Modem creates unified profiles that help you understand each user's feedback history and engagement patterns.

## How Participants Are Created

When Modem ingests messages, it extracts author information and creates participant profiles. As more data flows in, these profiles are enriched with:

- Messages across all connected sources
- Topics they've contributed to
- Feedback patterns (types of messages they send)
- Company associations (when identifiable)

## Cross-Platform Identity

When a user is active across multiple platforms, Modem can link their identities into a single participant profile.

<Info>
  Identity linking uses email addresses, usernames, and other signals. It's not always possible to link identities automatically—some users may appear as separate participants on different platforms.
</Info>

### Example

A user might be:
- `jane@acme.com` on Slack
- `janedoe` on Discord
- `jane-doe` on GitHub

If Modem can determine these are the same person (via shared email or explicit linking), they'll be consolidated into a single participant profile showing activity across all three platforms.

## Participant Profiles

Each participant profile includes:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Identity** | Name, avatar, email, and linked platform accounts |
| **Messages** | All messages they've sent across connected sources |
| **Topics** | Topics they've contributed to |
| **Feedback Breakdown** | Distribution of their messages by category (bugs, features, etc.) |
| **Activity Timeline** | When they've been active |
| **Company** | Associated company (when identifiable) |

## Working with Participants

### Browsing Participants

Navigate to **Participants** in your dashboard to see all users across your data sources.

Filter and sort by:
- **Activity** — Most recently active, most messages, most topics
- **Feedback type** — Users who report bugs, request features, etc.
- **Source** — Users from specific platforms
- **Company** — Users from specific companies

### Participant Details

Click on a participant to see their full profile:

- **Overview** — Summary of their engagement and feedback patterns
- **Messages** — Complete history of their messages across sources
- **Topics** — Topics they've participated in, with their specific contributions

### Searching for Participants

Use the search bar to find participants by:
- Name or username
- Email address
- Company name
- Message content (find people who mentioned specific things)

## Companies

Modem can associate participants with companies based on:
- Email domain (e.g., `jane@acme.com` → Acme Inc.)
- Explicit company data from integrations
- Manual assignments

### Company View

The **Companies** section in your dashboard aggregates participant data by organization:

- Total users from that company
- Combined feedback history
- Topics they care about
- Overall engagement level

This is useful for:
- Understanding which customers are most engaged
- Identifying company-specific issues
- Prioritizing feedback from key accounts

## Privacy Considerations

Participant data is only accessible to members of your Modem organization. Modem does not share participant data across organizations.

<Note>
  When connecting data sources, ensure you have appropriate permissions to access and analyze user data. Review your organization's privacy policies and data handling requirements.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identify your power users">
    Sort participants by message count or topic involvement to find your most engaged users. These are often great candidates for beta testing or customer interviews.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track feedback patterns">
    If a participant consistently reports bugs, they might be using your product in edge cases worth understanding. If they mostly request features, they might have ideas worth exploring.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use company view for B2B">
    If you serve business customers, the company view helps you understand account-level feedback patterns and identify accounts that may need attention.
