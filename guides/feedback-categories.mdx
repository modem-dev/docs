---

Modem automatically categorizes messages into feedback types, helping you quickly understand the nature of user communications without manual tagging.

## Feedback Types

Modem classifies messages into these categories:

### Bug Report

Something isn't working as expected. Users are reporting errors, broken functionality, or unexpected behavior.

**Examples:**
- "The export button doesn't work on Safari"
- "Getting a 500 error when I try to save"
- "The chart shows wrong data after filtering"

### Feature Request

Users suggesting new functionality or improvements to existing features.

**Examples:**
- "Would be great to have keyboard shortcuts"
- "Can you add dark mode support?"
- "It would help if we could export to CSV"

### Question

Users seeking help, clarification, or guidance on how to use the product.

**Examples:**
- "How do I reset my API key?"
- "What's the difference between these two options?"
- "Is there a way to bulk import?"

### Complaint

Users expressing frustration, dissatisfaction, or negative sentiment without necessarily reporting a specific bug.

**Examples:**
- "This is so slow and frustrating"
- "The new UI is confusing"
- "I've been waiting for this fix for months"

### Praise

Positive feedback, appreciation, or compliments about the product or team.

**Examples:**
- "Love the new dashboard design!"
- "This feature saved me hours of work"
- "Great support, thanks for the quick response"

## How Classification Works

Modem uses AI to analyze message content and context:

1. **Content Analysis** — The text of the message is analyzed for sentiment, intent, and keywords
2. **Context Signals** — Channel type, thread context, and conversation history provide additional signals
3. **Confidence Scoring** — Each classification includes a confidence score

<Info>
  Classification happens automatically as messages are ingested. There's no manual setup required.

## Using Feedback Categories

### Filtering by Category

Use the category filter in the **Feedback** view to see messages of a specific type:

- View all bug reports to understand reliability issues
- Browse feature requests to inform your roadmap
- Check complaints to identify user pain points
- Review praise to understand what's working well

### Dashboard Analytics

The dashboard shows feedback distribution over time:

- Are bug reports increasing? You might have a quality issue
- Spike in feature requests around a topic? Users want something specific
- Complaints trending up? Time to investigate

### Combining with Topics

Categories work alongside topics to give you a complete picture:

| Use Case | How to Find It |
|----------|----------------|
| Bugs about a specific feature | Filter topics by "bug report" category |
| Most requested features | Filter topics by "feature request" and sort by message count |
| Pain points for a customer | View participant profile, filter by "complaint" |

## Classification Accuracy

AI classification isn't perfect. Some messages may be:

- **Ambiguous** — "This doesn't work the way I expected" could be a bug report or a complaint
- **Multi-category** — "The export is broken and you really need to add CSV support" contains both a bug and a feature request
- **Contextual** — Sarcasm or complex context can lead to misclassification

<Tip>
  When a message contains multiple feedback types, Modem classifies it based on the primary intent. The full message is always available for context.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor bug report trends">
    Track the volume of bug reports over time. Increases after releases can indicate quality issues. Decreases after fixes confirm resolution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize by category + volume">
    A feature request mentioned once is noise. A feature request from 50 users across 3 months is signal. Use category filters with topic volume to prioritize.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't ignore praise">
    Praise tells you what's working. When users love a feature, that's signal about what to preserve and expand. It also identifies potential advocates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Investigate complaint spikes">
    Sudden increases in complaints often indicate breaking changes, performance issues, or unmet expectations. Investigate promptly.
  </Accordion>
