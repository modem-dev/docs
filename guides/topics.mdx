Topics are AI-discovered conversation themes that group related messages across your data sources. They're the primary way Modem helps you understand what users are talking about.

## How Topics Are Created

Modem uses a combination of semantic analysis and conversation detection to create topics:

1. **Message Embedding.** Each message is converted into a vector representation that captures its meaning.
2. **Similarity Matching.** New messages are compared against existing topics to find semantic matches.
3. **Conversation Segmentation.** Related messages in sequence are grouped together as a conversation.
4. **Topic Generation.** When a conversation doesn't fit existing topics, a new topic is created.

<Info>
  Topics are generated automatically. You don't need to tag, label, or categorize messages yourself.

## Anatomy of a Topic

Each topic includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | AI-generated summary of the topic theme |
| **Summary** | Brief description of what the topic covers |
| **Groups** | Conversation segments within the topic |
| **Messages** | Individual messages that belong to this topic |
| **Participants** | Users who contributed to discussions in this topic |
| **Confidence** | How strongly the messages match this topic |
| **Keywords** | Extracted terms that define this topic |

## Topic Groups

A topic can contain multiple **groups**, distinct conversations that share the same theme but happened at different times or in different contexts.

For example, a topic about "API rate limiting" might have:

- **Group 1**: Initial discussion about rate limit errors (January, Slack #support)
- **Group 2**: Feature request for rate limit headers (March, Discord #suggestions)
- **Group 3**: Bug report about incorrect 429 responses (May, GitHub Issues)

Groups help you see the evolution of a topic over time.

## Working with Topics

### Browsing Topics

Navigate to **Topics** in your dashboard to see all discovered topics. Topics are sorted by recent activity by default.

Use filters to narrow down:
- **Time range.** Topics with activity in a specific period.
- **Source.** Topics from specific channels or platforms.
- **Feedback type.** Topics containing bug reports, feature requests, etc.

### Searching Topics

Use the search bar to find topics by keyword or phrase. The search uses semantic matching, so you'll find related topics even if they don't contain your exact search terms.

<Tip>
  Searching for "authentication problems" will find topics about "login issues," "OAuth errors," and "sign-in bugs" due to semantic similarity.
</Tip>

### Topic Details

Click on a topic to see:
- All messages in the topic, organized by group
- Timeline of when messages were added
- Participants involved
- Source channels and platforms

## Topic Quality

Modem assigns a confidence score to each topic based on:
- How semantically similar the grouped messages are
- Whether the messages form coherent conversations
- The distinctiveness of the topic from other topics

Higher confidence topics have stronger thematic coherence. Lower confidence topics may need review: the messages might belong to separate topics, or the topic boundaries might need adjustment.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with high-activity channels">
    Topics are more meaningful when there's enough data. Start by connecting your busiest user-facing channels.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review new topics regularly">
    Check the Topics view periodically to spot emerging themes. New topics often indicate changing user needs or new pain points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use topics to inform roadmap">
    Topics with many participants and messages across time indicate persistent user needs. Use this signal for prioritization.
