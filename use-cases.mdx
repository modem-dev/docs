Modem helps teams turn scattered feedback into action. Here are three ways customers use Modem to stay connected with their users.

## Personalized Release Notes

**Problem:** You shipped a new feature, but how do you tell the right customers about it? Generic release notes don't resonate, and manually tracking who asked for what is tedious.

**Solution:** Use Modem to generate release notes tailored to each customer based on their actual feedback history.

### How It Works

1. **Connect your feedback sources.** Modem ingests conversations from Slack, Discord, GitHub, and email.
2. **Ship your feature.** When you close a Linear issue or merge a PR, Modem knows what was delivered.
3. **Generate personalized notes.** Ask the Modem Agent: "Which customers asked for [feature]? Draft release notes highlighting how this addresses their specific requests."

### Example

> **You:** We just shipped dark mode. Who requested this and what did they say?
>
> **Modem Agent:** 23 users requested dark mode over the past 6 months. Here are the top requesters:
>
> - **Sarah at Acme Corp** (3 requests): Mentioned eye strain during late-night debugging sessions
> - **DevTeam at StartupXYZ** (2 requests): Wanted it for customer demos to match their brand
> - **Marcus** (Discord): Asked specifically about OLED battery savings
>
> Draft release note for Sarah:
> *"Remember when you mentioned eye strain during those late-night debugging sessions? Dark mode is here. Your eyes will thank you."*

### Why It Matters

- Customers feel heard when you acknowledge their specific feedback
- Higher engagement with release announcements
- Builds loyalty by closing the feedback loop

## Weekly Feedback Digest

**Problem:** Your community is active on Discord, but leadership doesn't have time to read every message. Important signals get buried in the noise.

**Solution:** Automatically summarize bug reports and feature requests and deliver them via email every week.

### How It Works

1. **Connect Discord.** Modem captures all messages from your community channels.
2. **AI categorizes feedback.** Each message is classified as a bug report, feature request, question, complaint, or praise.
3. **Schedule a digest.** Set up a weekly task that summarizes feedback and emails it to your team.

### Example Digest

```
Weekly Feedback Summary: Jan 15-22

BUG REPORTS (12 total)

🔴 Critical: Export timeout affecting 8 users

⭐ Enterprise: SSO support (2 mentions from paying customers)

SENTIMENT

👍 Praise: 6 messages (new onboarding flow getting positive feedback)
👎 Complaints: 3 messages (pricing concerns from indie developers)
```

### Configuration

In Modem, create a scheduled task:
- **Schedule:** Every Monday at 9 AM
- **Query:** Summarize bug reports and feature requests from Discord, grouped by severity and popularity
- **Delivery:** Email to product@yourcompany.com

### Why It Matters

- Leadership stays informed without reading every message
- Trends become visible before they escalate
- Product decisions backed by aggregated community voice

## Closing the Loop on Feature Requests

**Problem:** A user requests a feature in Slack. Months later, you ship it but forget to tell them. They never know their feedback mattered.

**Solution:** Automatically notify users when their requested feature ships by connecting Modem to Linear.

### How It Works

1. **User requests a feature** in Slack, Discord, or any connected source.
2. **You create a Linear issue** and link it to the feedback, or let Modem track the connection.
3. **You ship and close the issue.** The Linear ticket moves to "Done."
4. **Modem notifies the requester** automatically, letting them know.

### Example Flow

**January 15: User requests feature**
> @support Can we get keyboard shortcuts? Would save me so much time.

**January 16: You create Linear issue**
> "Add keyboard shortcuts" (linked to Slack conversation)

**March 10: You ship and close the issue**

**March 10: Modem sends notification**
> Hey! Remember when you asked about keyboard shortcuts back in January?
> We just shipped it! Check out the new shortcuts in Settings → Keyboard.
> Thanks for the suggestion, this one's for you. 🎉

### Setting It Up

1. **Connect Linear.** Modem syncs your issues and their status.
2. **Enable close-the-loop automation.** In scheduled tasks, create a workflow triggered by Linear issue completion.
3. **Customize the message.** Personalize the notification template.

### Why It Matters

- Users feel valued when you follow up
- Increases trust and loyalty
- Creates advocates who see their feedback become reality
- Reduces "did you ever ship X?" questions
