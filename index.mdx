## What is Modem?

Modem is a developer-focused CRM that helps software teams understand what their users are actually saying. By connecting your communication channels—Discord, Slack, GitHub, Linear, and email—Modem aggregates and analyzes user feedback so you can act on it.

**The problem:** User feedback is scattered everywhere. Bug reports in Discord, feature requests in Slack, issues in GitHub. Teams waste hours scanning threads, chasing PMs for context, and manually triaging feedback. Critical signals get lost.

**The solution:** Modem automatically discovers conversations, extracts topics, and categorizes feedback. You get a single view of what users care about—without the manual work.
