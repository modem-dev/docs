Modem provides an MCP server that gives your AI tools direct access to your feedback data. Query user feedback, search topics, and look up customer context without leaving your editor.

**Why use it:**
- Surface relevant bug reports while you're fixing code
- Check what users are saying about a feature before you change it
- Pull customer context into conversations with Claude or Cursor

## Supported Clients

Modem's MCP server works with any MCP-compatible client:

- **Claude Desktop.** Anthropic's desktop app.
- **Cursor.** AI-powered code editor.
- **Continue.** Open-source AI coding assistant.
- **Other MCP clients.** Any tool implementing the MCP specification.

## Setup

### Get Your MCP Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    In your Modem dashboard, navigate to **Settings** → **API & Integrations**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate MCP credentials">
    Click **Generate MCP Token**. You'll receive:
    - Server URL

  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep credentials secure">
    Store these securely. The token provides access to your organization's feedback data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure Your Client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "modem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modem-dev/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MODEM_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "modem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modem-dev/mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "MODEM_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  After configuring, restart your client for changes to take effect.
</Tip>

## Example Usage

### In Claude Desktop

```
You: What are users complaining about in Modem?

Claude: [Queries Modem MCP server]

Based on your Modem data, here are the top complaints from the last 7 days:

1. **Export performance** (12 mentions) - Users report exports timing out for large datasets
2. **Mobile app stability** (8 mentions) - Crashes on Android 14 devices
3. **API rate limits** (5 mentions) - Requests for higher limits or better error messages

The export issue appears most urgent with multiple enterprise customers affected.
```

### In Cursor

While coding, you can ask about related feedback:

```
You: Are there any bug reports about the PaymentService in Modem?

Cursor: [Queries Modem MCP server]

I found 3 relevant bug reports:
- "Payment webhook failing silently" (2 days ago, Slack #support)
- "Double charges on retry" (5 days ago, GitHub issue #423)
- "Currency conversion wrong for EUR" (1 week ago, Discord)

The webhook issue might be related to the code you're working on.
```

## Permissions

The MCP token inherits your user permissions:

- Access to all data in your organization
- Read-only access (cannot modify data via MCP)
- Subject to the same data visibility rules as the dashboard

<Warning>
  Treat your MCP token like a password. Anyone with the token can access your organization's feedback data.
</Warning>

### Token Management

- **Regenerate.** If compromised, regenerate the token in Settings.
- **Revoke.** Delete the token to disable MCP access.
- **Multiple tokens.** Create separate tokens for different tools if needed.
