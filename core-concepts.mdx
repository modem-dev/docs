Modem transforms raw messages from your communication channels into structured, actionable insights. Here's how the key concepts work together.

## Messages & Events

At the foundation, Modem ingests **messages** and **events** from your connected data sources.

- **Messages** are individual pieces of communication: a Slack message, Discord post, GitHub comment, or email
- **Events** are actions or changes: a GitHub issue being opened, a reaction being added, a thread being started

Every message is enriched with metadata: author information, timestamps, channel context, and threading relationships.

## Topics

**Topics** are AI-discovered conversation themes. When users discuss similar subjects across different channels or time periods, Modem groups these conversations into topics.

<Info>
  Topics are generated automatically—you don't need to tag or categorize messages manually.
</Info>

A topic might be:
- "Users struggling with OAuth setup" (spanning Slack support questions and GitHub issues)
- "Feature request: Dark mode" (collected from Discord suggestions and email feedback)
- "Performance issues on mobile" (bug reports across multiple channels)

Each topic includes:
- An AI-generated title and summary
- The messages that belong to it
- Confidence scoring based on semantic similarity
- Key participants involved in the discussion

## Groups

**Groups** are conversation segments within a topic. A topic might contain multiple distinct conversations that happened at different times or in different contexts.

For example, a "Dark mode request" topic might have groups for:
- Initial feature request discussion (March)
- Follow-up questions after partial implementation (June)
- Bug reports about dark mode contrast issues (August)

Groups help you understand the timeline and evolution of a topic.

## Participants

**Participants** are the people interacting across your connected sources. Modem creates unified profiles for users, linking their identities across platforms when possible.

A participant profile shows:
- All messages they've sent across sources
- Topics they've contributed to
- Feedback patterns (do they report bugs? Request features? Offer praise?)
- Associated company (when identifiable)

## Feedback Categories

Modem automatically categorizes messages into feedback types:

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Bug Report** | Something isn't working as expected | "The export button doesn't work on Safari" |
| **Feature Request** | A suggestion for new functionality | "It would be great if we could filter by date" |
| **Question** | Seeking help or clarification | "How do I reset my API key?" |
| **Complaint** | Expressing frustration or dissatisfaction | "This is really slow and frustrating" |
| **Praise** | Positive feedback | "Love the new dashboard design!" |

This categorization happens automatically using AI analysis of message content and context.

## Channels

**Channels** represent the specific places where conversations happen:
- A Slack channel (#support, #feedback)
- A Discord server channel
- A GitHub repository
- An email inbox

Modem tracks which channels messages come from, letting you filter and analyze by source.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When a new message arrives:

1. **Ingestion** — The message is captured with full metadata
2. **Embedding** — AI generates a vector representation of the message content
3. **Classification** — The message is categorized by feedback type
4. **Topic Matching** — Semantic search finds related existing topics, or a new topic is created
5. **Group Assignment** — The message is assigned to a conversation group within the topic
6. **Participant Linking** — The author is linked to their unified participant profile

This processing happens in near real-time, so new messages appear in your dashboard within seconds.
